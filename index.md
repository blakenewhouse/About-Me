## About Me
Hi, my name is Blake Newhouse, and I am a second year Computer Science student at UCSD. When I am not studying, I love to snowboard, play basketball and volleyball, go to the beach, and watch sports.
I am a huge fan of both the San Diego Padres and Chelsea, and if you support any other teams your opinion is invalid(just kidding). I am originally from Encinitas, California, and have grew up in San Diego my whole life.

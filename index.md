## About Me
Hi, my name is Blake Newhouse, and I am a second year Computer Science student at UCSD. When I am not studying, I love to snowboard, play basketball and volleyball, go to the beach, and watch sports.
I am a huge fan of both the San Diego Padres and Chelsea, and if you support any other teams your opinion is invalid(just kidding). I am originally from Encinitas, California, and have grew up in San Diego my whole life. I also enjoy playing games like Pokemon, Hollow Knight, Celeste, and more.

## Life as a Programmer
In terms of coding, I enjoy coding using `Python`, `Java`, and `C++`. I am open to using other things, but these are the languages that I am most fmailiar with. A link to my GitHub is provided [here](https://github.com/blakenewhouse). Aside from schooling, I have done a couple of projects on my own but nothing super large scale, simply little things that I have done on my own for myself. At UCSD, I have taken many courses under the computer science department, and some of my favorites are listed below:

- CSE 100
- CSE 105
- CSE 130

The classes that I am still planning on taking and want to take are as follows:

- [x] CSE 110
- [x] CSE 151A
- [ ] CSE 150B
- [ ] CSE 131
